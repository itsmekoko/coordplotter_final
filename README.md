Basic Android app made with Kotlin programming language and Jetpack Compose UI toolkit
Welcome to the Pac-Man Slider app! This application utilizes the power of Jetpack Compose to create a fun, 
interactive experience where you can control the movement of a Pac-Man within a box by adjusting the X-axis 
and Y-axis sliders.

Features
Interactive Sliders: Adjust the X-axis and Y-axis sliders to move the Pac-Man across the screen.
Real-time Movement: Experience real-time movement of Pac-Man with smooth transitions and animations.
Jetpack Compose: Built using Jetpack Compose, Android's modern toolkit for building native UI.
Intuitive Interface: A user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use.

On week 2: Added a row composable with an inner text to show the percentage for the movement of the X and Y 
sliders. Moved out of the MainActivity the composable functions to separate files in a new package called 
components. Added a SplashScreen, changed Color.kt and the Theme.kt and transformed the moving circle to 
pac-man.
